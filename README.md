# Minimal React + TS + Tailwind + Supabase Setup

![](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=nodejs,vite,react,typescript,tailwind,supabase,postgresql)

Template for a minimal but modern set of tools to make development fast and efficient. It uses:
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for quick builds
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) with built-in routing
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety and aliases
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) to handle the backend and authentication.
- [Tailwind CSS v4.0](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling (w/ the official [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) plugin)

Also organized with a clean folder structure and preconfigured with linting and formatting tools to help keep everything consistent. 

Designed to avoid using any predefined UI libraries or global state managers, giving you a clean and flexible starting point, without locking you into specific choices, to build things in your own way.
